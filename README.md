# C Programming Laboratory Experiments

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the **C programming experiments** completed as part of my college curriculum, assigned by my course instructor. These experiments are designed to strengthen core programming concepts, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills using the C language.

All programs are written in **standard C**, compiled and tested using a GCC-compatible compiler.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand fundamentals of C programming
* Practice problem-solving using logic and algorithms
* Gain hands-on experience with procedural programming
* Learn efficient use of memory and files

## 🧪 List of Experiments

The repository includes programs based on the following topics:

1. Basic input/output operations
2. Control statements (if, if-else, switch)
3. Looping constructs (for, while, do-while)
4. Functions (user-defined and recursive)
5. Arrays (1D and 2D)
6. Strings and string manipulation
7. Pointers
8. Structures and unions
9. Enumerations and macros
10. File handling (reading and writing files)
11. Command-line arguments
12. Pattern printing and logical problems

> Each program includes proper comments and follows the format prescribed by the instructor.
